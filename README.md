# CombinedCodingStats

First of all, this was made purely for fun, I use a lot of multiple repositories at work and while freelancing, and always bothered be that I couldn't show my activity easily on my Github page, since GitHub is almost like my portfolio, so I created this project.

Unfortunately, we can't get the theme from the browser version, so please use the one you think best fits any theme.
Any theme suggestions are welcome!


# Usage:

### GitLab stats

Replace `YOURGITLABUSERNAME` with your gitlab user name and `YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` with you GitHub username to avoid redirecting.
!Atention: To display private contributions you need to enable "Include private contributions on my profile" in your GitLab Profile preferences.
